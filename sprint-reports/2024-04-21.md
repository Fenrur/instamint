## Sprint `[Start: 22 March 2024 and Finish: 21 April 2024]`



During this sprint, our team focused on establishing a solid foundation for the project.

We made crucial decisions on the technical stack and executed several foundational activities essential for a robust start.

The team effectively initiated the project, distributed tasks, and designed both the conceptual and physical models of the database.

We also developed comprehensive documentation, including the legal framework, use cases, and activity diagrams, which are crucial for understanding the project's structure and legal boundaries.

Additionally, we set up a continuous integration (CI) process to streamline our development workflow.

Significant achievements include implementing authentication mechanisms to secure access and conducting database migrations to ensure system integrity.

These efforts have successfully prepared us for collaborative development in the upcoming phases of the project.
