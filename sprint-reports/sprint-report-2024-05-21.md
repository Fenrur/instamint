# Sprint report

## Planning



## Sprint `[Start: 22 April 2024 and Finish: 21 May 2024]`

During this sprint the team was more focused on finishing tasks we didn't finish last sprint.

Then we keep on the features of the application to make it functional.

We worked on the profile, user settings, followers and on the admin features.

The work is not completely finished yet, but it is on the good way.
